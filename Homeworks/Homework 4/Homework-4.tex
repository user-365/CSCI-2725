%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Document-level
% - make separate latex file to preload preamble
% - make separate latex file as my design ethos manifesto
%
% Component-level
% - \textbf{Show}case other things (e.g. codeblocks, highlighting, qeding)
% - make remarks and proof? blocks (tcolorbox)
%
% Text-level
% - override \Vec (`asmmath`?) command with my own
% - fix vertical spacing between Comment and math
% - directional (from NW, bend, to W) arrows for proof comments (first instance)
% ✅ align 2nd level enumeration items with 1st level (ask on stackexchange)
% --- create "CSCI-2725" enum environment to handle this
% --- solution (in question): https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/419352/
% - fix square root sign stroke thickness (too thick) in single-$/text-math mode
% ✅ center (align*) equations in prompt in various problems (enumerate)
% --- solution (2nd part of ans.): https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/54686/
% --- other solution (more flexible but needs multiple compilation): https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/9640/
%
% Comment-level

\maketitle

\textbf{Extra credit:} There is 5 percentage extra credit if you don't submit hand-written homework (including the diagrams).
You can use \LaTeX\ or any other tool to write your homework.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item (20 points) \textbf{Construct} an AVL tree using the following input (in the
    given order)
    \begin{equation*}
      50,\ 26,\ 72,\ 12,\ 11,\ 25,\ 68,\ 45,\ 55,\ 77,\ 47
    \end{equation*}

    \textbf{Show} which node got unbalanced, what rotation operation you need
    to perform and all the intermediate steps as you are performing the
    rotation operations (something similar to examples shown in the class).

    \textbf{Show} all your intermediate steps including the recoloring and restruc-
    turing operations.

    \textit{Note:} nodes circled in red mean red nodes, in black means black nodes, regardless of node text or background color.
