%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Document-level
% - make separate latex file to catalogue (my) custom macros
% - make separate latex file as my design ethos manifesto
%
% Component-level
% - showcase other things (e.g. codeblocks, highlighting, qeding)
% - make remarks, proof? blocks (tcolorbox)
% - add captions/labels to mymintedcodeblocks (tcolorbox)
%
% Text-level
% - fix vertical spacing between Comment and math
% - directional (from NW, bend, to W) arrows for proof comments (first instance)
% - fix square root sign stroke thickness (too thick) in single-$/text-math mode
% ? align 2nd level enumeration items with 1st level (ask on stackexchange)
% ? center equations in prompt in various problems
%
% Comment-level
% - switch "See" to "Credit" appropriately

\maketitle

\textbf{Extra credit:} There is 5 percentage extra credit if you don't submit hand-written homework.
You can use \LaTeX or any other tool to write your homework.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (5 points each) Look at the pseudocode below,
  and find the Big-$O$ estimate or worst case complexity of the following recursive functions.

  \textbf{Hint:} Write recurrence relation for the functions and solve it using Master's Theorem.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}{java}
      void fun(int n, int m) {
        if (m > n) return;
        System.out.print("m = " + m);
        fun(n, m + 2);
      }
\end{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}



\newpage



\begin{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}{java}
      float fun(int a[], int i) {
        if (i == 0) {
          return a[0];
        }
        if (i > 0) {
          return (i * fun(a, i - 1) + a[i])/(i + 1);
        }
      }
\end{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}



\newpage



Assume that the function "random" has a complexity of $O(n)$.
\begin{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}{java}
      void fun(int array[], int a, int b) {
        if (a > b) return;
        mid = (a + b)/2;
        fun(array, a, mid);
        fun(array, mid + 1, b);
        random(array, a, mid, b);
      }
\end{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}



\newpage



\begin{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}{java}
      int fun(int x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return x;
        if (n % 2 == 0) return fun(x * x, n / 2);
        else return x * fun(x * x, n / 2);
      }
\end{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}



\newpage



\begin{enumerate}[resume]

  \item (10 points) Consider a recurrence relation given by following.
  \begin{equation*}
    T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 2^n
  \end{equation*}
  
  Show that $T(n)=n2^n$ is the solution of the above equation.
  If you need a base case, use $T(0)=0$.



  \newpage



  \item (10 points) Below is the code for Fibonacci sequence. Write a recurrence relation for this code and solve it using substitution (forward or backward) method.
  
  \textbf{Note:} There are two recurrence relations $T(n-1)$ and $T(n-2)$ and to simplify your calculation you can assume that $T(n-1)=T(n-2)$ as they are almost of same size.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}{java}
      int Fibonacci(int N) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
          return 1;
        }
        else {
          return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
        }
      }
\end{MintedUnbreakableCodeBlock}
