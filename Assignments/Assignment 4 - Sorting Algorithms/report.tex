% TK TODO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Document-level
% - make separate latex file to preload preamble
% - make separate latex file as my design ethos manifesto
%
% Component-level
% - showcase other things (e.g. codeblocks, highlighting, qeding)
% - make remarks and proof? blocks (tcolorbox)
%
% Text-level
% - override \Vec (`asmmath`?) command with my own
% - fix vertical spacing between Comment and math
% - directional (from NW, bend, to W) arrows for proof comments (first instance)
% ✅ align 2nd level enumeration items with 1st level (ask on stackexchange)
% --- create "CSCI-2725" enum environment to handle this
% --- solution (in question): https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/419352/
% - fix square root sign stroke thickness (too thick) in single-$/text-math mode
% ✅ center (align*) equations in prompt in various problems (enumerate)
% --- solution (2nd part of ans.): https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/54686/
% --- other solution (more flexible but needs multiple compilation): https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/9640/
%
% Comment-level

        \item \textbf{Provide} the total number of comparisons used by each one of the algorithms
        and explain whether they align with the Big-$O$ time complexity of each algorithm.
        In the case of quicksort, compare and comment about the number of comparisons and complexity with the other quicksort implementation.

        \hspace*{\fill} \textbf{Explanation:} It was to avoid overriding the original array.
